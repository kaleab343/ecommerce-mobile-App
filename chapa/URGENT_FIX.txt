URGENT: You MUST Update Your Android Code
===============================================================================

PROBLEM:
Your app is calling the WRONG server IP address.

Current situation:
- Your app sends to: 192.168.1.2 ✅
- Your app verifies to: 192.168.1.3 ❌ WRONG!
- Verification codes are stored on: 192.168.1.2

This is why you get "email not found" - the code is on server .2 but you're 
looking for it on server .3!

===============================================================================
HOW TO FIX:
===============================================================================

Open Android Studio and find sign_in_page.java

Look for the checkCodeWithServer method (around line 153)

FIND THIS LINE:
    URL url = new URL("http://192.168.1.3/chapa/mailer/validmailer.php");

CHANGE IT TO:
    URL url = new URL("http://192.168.1.2/chapa/mailer/validmailer.php");

OR copy the entire file from sign_in_page_updated.java which I already fixed.

Then:
1. Rebuild your app
2. Install it on your phone
3. Try signing up again

===============================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: Use the updated file I created
===============================================================================

The file sign_in_page_updated.java has ALL the fixes already applied.

Just copy its contents into your Android project's sign_in_page.java file.
